#Web Development Tools


The following screens are open on your computer:

![](./img/01.png)
Sublime Text Editor, this is where you will write your code for creating the website.



![](./img/02.png)
Chrome Web Browser, this is the application you use to view you website locally on your computer and remotely on the Internet.


##Structure

To develop a web page you must have a html code that the web browser understands and presents as a web page.

![](./img/04.png)

The code you see in your Sublime editor is html code. It contains two parts, the `<head`> shown as the green section, and the `<body`> shown as the red section.

You will not be making changes to the `<head`> section, all of your code will be put into the `<body`> which at the moment is blank. While it is blank the webpage open in the browser is also empty of any content and displays just as a white page. 

- Copy the following lines of code (highlight the code, right click and choose copy) 

~~~

    <header class="ui two column center aligned middle aligned grid segment">
      <div class="ui column">
        <h2 class="ui header"> Department of Computing &amp; Mathematics </h2>
        <h3 class="ui header">Computing Summer Camp</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="ui column">
        <p>
        </p>
      </div>
    </header>
~~~     

- Go to the Sublime text editor and paste the code so that it appears in between the `<body`> and the `</body`>
- It should look like this:

- From the File menu choose Save.

- You should see the following appear in your web page:

- You have now edited your html code so that the text will show in the browser. Next we will add more content.

- Copy the following code 

~~~

 <div class="ui container">
      <div class="ui cards">
        <div class="card" id="spotify">
          <div class="content">
            <div class="header">
             Spotify
            </div>
            <div class="meta">
             Music for everyone
            </div>
            <div class="description">
            There are millions of songs on Spotify. Play your favorites, discover new tracks, and build the perfect collection.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
~~~

- Go back to the Sublime text editor and paste it into the html code so that it comes directly after the `</header`> as you can see below:

- Once you are happy that your code looks the same as the image above then choose Save from the File menu.
- Go to the Chrome web browser and click the refresh button to be able to view the changes you made.

Your web page should now look like this.

- Scroll back up to the top of this page and click on step 02 in this lab (link is in the top bar of this web page).
