#Publishing the web site

Somewhere on our desktop you should have a `Command Prompt` windows looking something like this:

Select this window, and enter the following `command` :

~~~
surge
~~~

When you press return, then the command prompt will look like this:

(you might need to press return a few times to skip over the defaults).

When the publishing is finished - then you can try the link the project is published at (in green in the above):

- <http://curious-roll.surge.sh>

This link is now public! Ask your neighbour to look at your link and give him/her yours. 


##Challenge

- See if you can create a card with an image that, when you click on it, visits your neighbours page - or any other page in the class.

- When you run surge - you can enter in part of the name that the pages is published to. For instance

In the above, we are typing 'janes-page' so that we are getting a different link generated:
