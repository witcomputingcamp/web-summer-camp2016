#Images

Next we want to add some images to our web page.

- In your website folder you will see another folder called assets, in that folder you can see a folder called images.

- The Images folder contains 4 images, the first one we will use is wit-crest.png
- Copy the following line of code.

~~~
<img class="header-crest-img" src="assets/images/wit-crest.png" alt="WIT Crest">
~~~

- Go to Sublime text editor and place the line of code inside the `<h2`> and `</h2`> alongside the text Department of Computing & Mathematics so that it looks like this:

- Choose save from the File menu in Sublime 

- Go to the Chrome web browser and click the refresh button to see the result.

- You should see the W.I.T crest banner appear in the top left corner of header.
- Next we want to add an image to the Spotify content.
- Copy the following code.

~~~
       <img class="left floated small ui image" src="assets/images/spotify.png">

~~~

- Go to Sublime text editor and paste the code so that it appears just after the `<div class="content"`>

- If you are happy that your code looks the same as above then choose Save from the File menu.
- Go to the Chrome web browser and click the refresh button.

- Now that we have the Spotify image visible the text to the right isn't really needed. Try removing the text "Spotify" so that the content looks the same as this:

- You do this by going to Sublime text editor and deleting the code:

~~~
<div class="header">
  Spotify
</div>
~~~

Your code now looks like this:
